Since we are using zshrc we add aliases and stuff alike at

~/.zshrc

- After adding something like:

```
alias myscript="~/yourscript.sh"
```

You can save the file, and source it `source ~/.zshrc`

- You also need to install `pacman-contrib`

```
yay -S pacman-contrib
```

In there the `paccache` program lives, and that's what we use to clear the pacman cache

- yay and some packages might require `package-config` you can install it easily though:

```
yay -S pkgconfig
yay -S pkgconf
```

I installed the first one and it allowed me to install it

- Also install m4

```
yay -S m4
```

When writing bash scripts

If you are aliasing something that needs to have variables passed onto it,
specially a bash script you can do something like:

```
test --upgrade
```

The alias can be declared as a function in `zshrc`:

``
test() {
	"./../../script.sh" "$@"
}
```
