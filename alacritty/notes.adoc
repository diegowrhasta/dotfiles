Some help in regards to setting up Alacritty correctly.

## Setting up icon and desktop entry (GNOME)

Since the setup is aimed at Manjaro-GNOME. This will be focused on the conventions
of said setup to get a working icon for Alacritty.

First of all. Desktop entries can be sourced from

```
/usr/share/applications/
```

It's in there that you should put the `Alacritty.desktop` entry so that it can
then be searched for, and also added to the _Dock Bar_.

After that, so that the icon gets resolved correctly, you can put it in `/usr/share/pixmaps/`.
So copy the `.svg` file that's in the folder these notes are in. After that you
should have the entry available to use and to execute alacritty.

## Extra (if cargo installed Alacritty)

To have the terminal access the alacritty executable, you have to add the bin
path to your path. This can easily be done by adding the path in `.zshrc`:

```
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.cargo/bin"
```
