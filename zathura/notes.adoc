# Introduction

Zathura is a lightweight pdf visualizer. It has vim-like motions so it's pretty
convenient.

## Notes

- t = This allows to switch from dark to light mode. It's actually a re-color from
its stock type of behavior and a back and forth.
- z + i = Zoom in
- z + o = Zoom out
- Zathura needs a backend (plugin), so be sure to install it before trying to
open files: `yay -S zathura-pdf-mupdf`
