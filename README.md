# Introduction

A simple repository to keep track of all the dotfiles that I have setup for my
personal Linux distro (Manjaro with GNOME).

_I might put other stuff in here besides just the dotfiles, I'll also look into
doing a full automated script that can copy all of these things to their respective
places and get an environment up and running in no time_

## Dotfiles

As a broad definition, _Dotfiles_ are the slang term used in the** GNU/Linux sphere**
to refer to **config files** (most of the time) that help shape up **tools behaviors**
and extend with other functionalities as well. In short, every setup has the
capability of **personalizing its experience** to the user's needs (_this is why Linux
is so awesome_).

I have my **own way of working and preferences**, and since these config files are
just **plain text**, they are totally up for grabs for versioning such as **Git**,
and besides, through an actual history you can go back to a working state before
you messed everything up.

And not just that, this allows for one to **document everything** he has done to his
workstation, since we tend to forget as time goes on as to the things we installed,
the commands we ran, and overall setups we make.
